Goals:

    Analyze glucose levels before and after GTT ingestion.
    Identify if the glucose levels are above the diabetic threshold.
    Evaluate if the patient shows signs of insulin resistance.

Data Structure:

We'll assume the data is in a CSV file with the following columns:

    timestamp: The date and time of the glucose measurement.
    glucose_level: The measured glucose level.

Analysis Steps:

    Load the data.
    Filter data for before and after GTT ingestion.
    Descriptive statistics for glucose levels.
    Plot glucose levels over time to visualize the response to the GTT.
    Determine if glucose levels exceed diabetic thresholds at specified times.
    Evaluate insulin resistance by analyzing the glucose level decrease over time.

# Load the data
file_path = 'glucose_data.csv'  # Replace with your file path
data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Convert timestamp to datetime
data['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(data['timestamp'])

# Descriptive statistics
descriptive_stats = data['glucose_level'].describe()
print("Descriptive Statistics:")
print(descriptive_stats)

# Identify GTT timepoints
# Assuming GTT starts at a specific time and we know the ingestion time, e.g., '2023-01-01 08:00:00'
gtt_start_time = pd.to_datetime('2023-01-01 08:00:00')
gtt_end_time = gtt_start_time + pd.Timedelta(hours=2)

# Filter data before and after GTT
before_gtt = data[data['timestamp'] < gtt_start_time]
after_gtt = data[(data['timestamp'] >= gtt_start_time) & (data['timestamp'] <= gtt_end_time)]

# Plotting glucose levels before and after GTT
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(data['timestamp'], data['glucose_level'], marker='o', linestyle='-', label='Glucose Level')
plt.axvline(gtt_start_time, color='r', linestyle='--', label='GTT Start')
plt.axvline(gtt_end_time, color='g', linestyle='--', label='GTT End')
plt.title('Glucose Levels Before and After GTT')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Glucose Level')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

# Check if glucose levels exceed diabetic thresholds
# According to ADA, a 2-hour glucose level > 200 mg/dL indicates diabetes
diabetic_threshold = 200
diabetic_points = after_gtt[after_gtt['glucose_level'] > diabetic_threshold]

print("Diabetic Points After GTT:")
print(diabetic_points)

# Evaluate insulin resistance by analyzing the decrease in glucose level
initial_glucose_level = after_gtt.iloc[0]['glucose_level']
final_glucose_level = after_gtt.iloc[-1]['glucose_level']
glucose_decrease = initial_glucose_level - final_glucose_level
print(f"Initial Glucose Level: {initial_glucose_level} mg/dL")
print(f"Final Glucose Level: {final_glucose_level} mg/dL")
print(f"Glucose Decrease: {glucose_decrease} mg/dL")

# Save results
diabetic_points.to_csv('diabetic_points_after_gtt.csv', index=False)


Explanation:

    Load the data: Reads the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
    Convert timestamp: Ensures the timestamp column is in datetime format.
    Descriptive statistics: Provides basic statistics for glucose levels.
    Identify GTT timepoints: Specifies the start and end time of the GTT.
    Filter data: Separates the data into before and after the GTT ingestion periods.
    Plot glucose levels: Visualizes glucose levels over time with markers for GTT start and end times.
    Diabetic threshold check: Identifies points where glucose levels exceed 200 mg/dL after GTT.
    Evaluate insulin resistance: Compares initial and final glucose levels after GTT to assess the body's response.
    Save results: Exports any points exceeding the diabetic threshold to a CSV file.
